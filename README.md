#One Cent for the World

##Where it come from?

We live in a world full of inequalities, either on poverty, education or technology development. In the last years, the world progress has been based on technology and the poor countries have struggled to follow up with that development. We think that technology will not solve the problems of the world for itself. To solve these problems, we need to make a solidary and humanitarian effort.

Our solution is to channel this solidarity from the developed countries to the poorest ones, based on a simple premise: Give one cent for the World. One cent may be nothing for the most of the population in developed countries, but together all of them can help change the world.
And how can we give a cent to the world? Well, we created a new ecommerce platform where everyone can make payments, and for every payment, one cent is donated to a humanitarian organization. And we went even further, you don't just donate a cent to a random organization, the cent will revert to an organization that, somehow, tries to resolve a UN Millennium Goal related to the buy that you just did. If you buy foods, the cent will go to an organization who tries to end hunger.
